# ECG-Arrhythmia-Detector

Developed a neural network model to detect arrhythmia from raw ECG signals captured using the AD8232 sensor, achieving 90.87% accuracy. Mitigated class imbalance using SMOTE and by merging data from multiple datasets. Deployment on ESP32 microcontroller is currently in progress.
